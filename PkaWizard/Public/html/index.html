        <p>
            <b>Q: What the f*ck is this?</b><br />
            A: Pka-Wizard is a little tool that allows the user to upload any PacketTracer 7 (.pka) file to then read or overwrite its original content.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Q: Can I do anything cool with it?</b><br />
            A: Yes, it is possible to exploit the .pka file by inject JavaScript into the file, resulting in execution of the code for whoever opens the infected file.
